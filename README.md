# Diceware exercice

[Read about Diceware][homepage]

## Dice

Since there can be some confusion in generating proper
dicerolls, there is `DiceTest`.

## Wordmapping

A [wordlist], standard english, is downloaded from Diceware
and can be found in [resources][wordlist-resource].

Testing is done in `WordmappingTest`

## Random letter

To increase the security, one can use a random letter to replace
a random letter in a random word.

Test of the random character is done in `RandomLetterTest`

## The main

Finally, implement the main() in `Application.java`,
no test here though - to lazy to write some test for ... random.
